# The Week Project #

The WeekProject is both a site that you can use at [WeekProject.com](https://weekproject.com/)
and an open source project which you can find at [WeekProject.org](https://weekproject.org/).

Funnily enough, the original WeekProject website was intended as a WeekProject, however I did three days and stopped
due to other commitments. The second time I started the WeekProject, I started afresh and finished v1.0 within the
week.

The Week Project is on Twitter at [@weekproject](https://twitter.com/weekproject).

## Inspiration ##

The whole inspiration of the WeekProject is you give you impetus to learn something new, over the course of a
week. There is no direction from us or anyone else, but your own internal desire to do something.

If this is not quite enough, the you can create a project at the WeekProject with some details, then keep a running log
of it through the week. Once you've done that, the best thing to do is post updates about your WeekProject to your
social networks so that others around you can keep you honest and to task. :)
